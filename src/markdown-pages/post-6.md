Accomanied by a video piece projected onto the tarp screen within, this piece is a testament to my childhood in Wenling. On hot summer nights, I'd hide under mosquito netting in silence with my sister, listening to the drone of insects inside the house and the occasional fizzle of an incandescent lamppost and watching the orange-yellow light dance on the ceiling of our shared bedroom.
