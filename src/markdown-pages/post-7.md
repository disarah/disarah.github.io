I created a sprawling interactive fiction novel/game on the Twine game engine. This particular game follows a person named John as he maneuvers through office tasks, though not everything is as it seems. I found this project really enjoyable because I learned a lot about game design and Sugarcube, which is an alternate Javascript library for Twine. Creating this game also let me stretch my creative writing muscles!
