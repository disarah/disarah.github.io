Created as an explorative piece on the significance and impact of signage in tandem with concerns of rising sea levels due to global warming. I purposefully chose an innocuous question that is often commonly heard near bodies of water like at the beach or a communal swimming pool. 

By placing this phrase in a  different setting, it challenges the expectation of the occasional passerby, prompting them to think about our relationship with water and "how long" it will last.
