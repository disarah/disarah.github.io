This film was made possible in part by the support of the [72 Hour Film Shootout](https://www.asianamericanfilmlab.com/72-hour-shootout/) presented by the Asian American Film Lab. Based on the theme "Be a Hero," teams were given 72 hours to draft, shoot, and edit a short film. This proved to be very difficult for me, as I was working full-time during the 72 hour period, and solo. Despite these challenges, I won Best Editor and Outstanding Female Content Creator for my film, Be Your Own Hero.
