This digital space is home to most of my projects, though the best way to stay up-to-date with my shenanigans is on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/difriendlygrape\">Twitter</a>!</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Guzheng</h3>\n<p><img src=\"../images/camera/selfies/guzheng.jpg\" alt=\"guzheng\"></p>\n<p>I play an ancient Chinese instrument called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guzheng\">Guzheng</a>, and have performed as an artist of the <a href=\"http://guzhengusa.org/\">Washington Guzheng Society</a>. I’ve performed from private homes to public live broadcasts and even at Carnegie Hall, and have been certified by the China Conservatory of Music as a Level 10 guzheng artist.</p>\n<p>The guzheng, also known as the Chinese zither, is a 21-string table harp. You play it by plucking the strings with picks taped to your fingers. You can also change the sound by pressing down on strings for vibrato or by where you pluck on the instrument. Some more contemporary pieces employ slapping and knocking on the guzheng which can be more rhythmically fun!</p>\n<p>Check out my <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/sarahdi\">Soundcloud</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1UFKXagIJY3S_jjYjXxJqg\">Youtube channel</a> for more recordings.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>School</h3>\n<p>I’m a college senior at Carnegie Mellon University in the BXA program studying computer science and art with a concentration in electronic and time based media. I am interested in the intersection of art and technology.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/camera/selfies/dwm.jpg\" alt=\"dwm\"></p>\n<p>Me in Prof. Golan Levin's Drawing with Machines class (2021)</p>\n<p>(plz ignore my poor posture XD)</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Site Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>This site was created with <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/\">Gatsby</a>.</p>\n<p>In the past, I coded this site with the help of <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap's</a> handy dandy grid system.
