I revisited the genre last winter out of a desire to contextualize and analyze what I had listened to (a lot) back then. And after listening to many vocaloid songs, two things stuck out to me: the majority of the vocaloid songs I heard used feminine sounding voicebanks, and the majority were produced by mainly male composers for majority male audiences.</p>\n<p>The vocaloid industry also builds entire personas for these voicebanks, the most popular example of which is Hatsune Miku. The public reaction to Hatsune Miku, who some describe as a virtual idol and others as a tool, broaches multiple questions about use of the female persona solely for aesthetics or as an object of display.</p>\n<p>Watching these vocaloid music videos made me increasingly aware of the implicit manipulation of women in these videos, some of which depict little girls going through abuse and sexual trauma. I wanted to make my own vocaloid song as a direct commentary on this objectification. I also thought it would be interesting if this project was complicated by the fact that the theme is being injected into the very genre the commentary is about.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XTJJX-nuR30\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 02, 2022","title":"be loved","showDate":true,"featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.8652482269503545,"src":"/static/49cb86b47e936bdf75c7ed70b65f84a2/382d4/be-loved.png","srcSet":"/static/49cb86b47e936bdf75c7ed70b65f84a2/90171/be-loved.png 263w,\n/static/49cb86b47e936bdf75c7ed70b65f84a2/382d4/be-loved.png 298w","sizes":"(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px"}}},"featuredImageAlt":"a black screen with the words oh i don't know"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/be-loved"}},
